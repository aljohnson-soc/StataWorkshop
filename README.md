With the goal of effectively integrating statistical software into statistics course curricula, this workshop is designed to introduce students to Stata and teach the logic behind using software for statistical analyses. This workshop is two-hours long, appropriate for either undergraduate or graduate students, and can be presented to students at the beginning of a course term to prepare them to use Stata throughout the term. 

This workshop is part of a research project. Please cite as:

Additional information about the study design is available [here](Appendix_DataMethods.pdf). The workshop has been adapted for asychronous online learning. See links below.

A preliminary version of the project was presented (virtually) at the American Sociological Association's 2020 Annual Meeting. Slides from that presentation are available [here](Johnson_Gleit_ASA2020.pdf).

## Learning goals
- understand how data are stored in Stata
- use logical if-statements to subset data
- use a .do file to write reproducible code
- begin to use functions to manipulate data (e.g., variable creation)
